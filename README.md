# Encryption-Decryption

A simple program to understand the concept of encrption and decryption.
<br>
<h2>How to run the program </h2>
To add content in your file open the <b>password.c</b> file. The file will be encrypted and the content will then be kept in a text file <b>password.txt</b>.<br>
To decrypt the file open the file <b>manager.c</b> and the content of the file will be decrpted and will be stored in <b>man.txt</b>.
<br>
<h3>How the Encrytpion work:</h3><br>
Once the user inputs thier required content it is then stored in the file now the we read evey character from the file and add key value <b>i.e 100 </b> to every character so that if someone opens the file does not show the actucal content.<br>
<h3>How the Decrytpion work:</h3><br>
In the same way as encryption we now subtract the key value <b> i.e 100 </b> and store in man.txt file and decrypt the content.

<h4>You can change the key value in the sourse code, make sure you add and subtract the same exact key value for both encryption and decryption</h4>
